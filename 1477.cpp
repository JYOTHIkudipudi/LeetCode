/*  1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum

You are given an array of integers arr and an integer target.

You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with a sum equal target. 
There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays 
as the sum of their lengths is 2.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
1 <= target <= 108  */

            while (sum > target) {
                sum -= arr[left++];
            }

            // Carry forward the best subarray found so far
            if (right > 0)
                best[right] = best[right - 1];

            // Found a subarray [left...right] with sum = target
            if (sum == target) {
                int len = right - left + 1;

                // Need another subarray completely before 'left'
                if (left > 0 && best[left - 1] != INF) {
                    ans = min(ans, len + best[left - 1]);
                }

                // Store the shortest valid subarray ending at or before right
                best[right] = min(best[right], len);
            }
        }

        return ans == INF ? -1 : ans;
    }
